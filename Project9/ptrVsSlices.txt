numbers *[]int:

    This is a pointer to a slice. It means that numbers is a pointer to a slice of integers.
    When you pass a pointer to a slice, modifications made to the slice inside a function will affect the original slice outside the function.


----------------------------------------------------------------

numbers []int:

    This is a slice itself (not a pointer to a slice). When you pass a slice to a function, a copy of the slice header is made, but both the original and the copy refer to the same underlying array.
    Modifications to the elements of the slice inside a function will affect the original slice.

Example:

package main

import "fmt"

func modifySlicePointer(numbers *[]int) {
    // Modifying the slice through the pointer
    *numbers = append(*numbers, 4)
}

func modifySliceDirect(numbers []int) {
    // Modifying the slice directly
    numbers = append(numbers, 4)
}

func main() {
    nums := []int{1, 2, 3}

    // Pass a pointer to a slice
    modifySlicePointer(&nums)
    fmt.Println(nums) // Output: [1 2 3 4]

    // Pass a slice directly
    modifySliceDirect(nums)
    fmt.Println(nums) // Output: [1 2 3 4]
}

In this example, notice that modifySlicePointer modifies the original slice because it operates on the slice through a pointer. However, modifySliceDirect does not affect the original slice because it works with a copy of the slice header, and any changes made inside the function do not impact the original slice outside the function.

While the behavior in simple scenarios might seem similar, the distinction becomes more apparent when you work with functions that need to modify the slice itself (e.g., appending elements to the slice). In such cases, passing a pointer to a slice allows modifications to the original slice, whereas passing a slice directly works with a copy and doesn't affect the original slice.

In both cases, you are working with references to the underlying array. The difference lies in how you pass and handle the slice within functions.

    If you pass a pointer to a slice, changes to the slice inside the function affect the original slice.
    If you pass a slice directly, changes to the elements of the slice inside the function affect the original slice.

Note: In Go, slices are reference types, and when you pass a slice to a function, you are passing a reference to the underlying array. The distinction between these two cases is more about how the slice is passed and handled within functions.
